Last wired relay needs to be backwards from the rest in order to have the filter run 24/7.
Five relays total = five output LED's + one maintenance mode LED = SIX total LED's.

Time to dispense 1 ml: 1000 ms or 1 second.

Create a ground rail and run to all AC outlets and AC inlet.
One leg of the AC outlet on a rail to AC inlet.
Second leg of each outlet coming from relay board.
Rail from AC inlet going to each relay board relay.
